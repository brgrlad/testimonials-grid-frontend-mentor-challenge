# testimonials-grid-frontend-mentor-challenge
My take on another Fronted Mentor's challenge. This time I'm using pure HTML and CSS to get things done. The challenge was a great opportunity for me to explore a bit more of the flexbox layout model. 

Please note that no other info rather than colors and font sizes were provided, meaning I had to deal with spacing and responsiveness according to my own judgment.

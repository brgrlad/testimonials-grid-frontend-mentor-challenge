# testimonials-grid-frontend-mentor-challenge
My take on another Fronted Mentor's challenge. This time I'm using pure HTML and CSS to get it done. The challenge was a great opportunity for me to explore a bit more of the flexbox layout model. 

Note that no any other info rather than colors and font sizes were provided, meaning I had to the deal with spacing and responsiviness according to my own judgement.
